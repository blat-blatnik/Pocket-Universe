# Pocket-Universe
A particle simulation running in parallel on the GPU using compute shaders. In this particle system the particles can attract and repel each other in a small radius and it looks astounding and very life-like when running in real time. I optimized it as much as I could. The current system can simulate around 100,000-200,000 particles in real-time (30fps) on a modern GPU.
